 My father had a small estate in Nottinghamshire: I was 
the third of five sons. He sent me to Emanuel College 
in Cambridge at fourteen years old, where I resided three 
years, and applied myself close to my studies; but the charge 
of maintaining me, although I had a very scanty allowance, 
being too great for a narrow fortune, I was bound appren
tice to Mr. James Bates, an eminent surgeon in London, 
with whom I continued four years. My father now and then 
sending me small sums of money, I laid them out in learn
ing navigation, and other parts of the mathematics, useful 
to those who intend to travel, as I always believed it would 
be, some time or other, my fortune to do. When I left Mr. 
Bates, I went down to my father: where, by the assistance of 
him and my uncle John, and some other relations, I got forty 
pounds, and a promise of thirty pounds a year to maintain 
me at Leyden: there I studied physic two years and seven 
months, knowing it would be useful in long voyages.
 Soon after my return from Leyden, I was recommended

by my good master, Mr. Bates, to be surgeon to the Swal
low, Captain Abraham Pannel, commander; with whom I 
continued three years and a half, making a voyage or two 
into the Levant, and some other parts. When I came back I 
resolved to settle in London; to which Mr. Bates, my master, 
encouraged me, and by him I was recommended to several 
patients. I took part of a small house in the Old Jewry; and 
being advised to alter my condition, I married Mrs. Mary 
Burton, second daughter to Mr. Edmund Burton, hosier, in 
Newgate-street, with whom I received four hundred pounds 
for a portion.
 But my good master Bates dying in two years after, and 
I having few friends, my business began to fail; for my con
science would not suffer me to imitate the bad practice of 
too many among my brethren. Having therefore consulted 
with my wife, and some of my acquaintance, I determined 
to go again to sea. I was surgeon successively in two ships, 
and made several voyages, for six years, to the East and 
West Indies, by which I got some addition to my fortune. My 
hours of leisure I spent in reading the best authors, ancient 
and modern, being always provided with a good number of 
books; and when I was ashore, in observing the manners 
and dispositions of the people, as well as learning their lan
guage; wherein I had a great facility, by the strength of my 
memory.
 T
 he last of these voyages not proving very fortunate, I 
grew weary of the sea, and intended to stay at home with 
my wife and family. I removed from the Old Jewry to Fetter 
Lane, and from thence to Wapping, hoping to get business

among the sailors; but it would not turn to account. After 
three years expectation that things would mend, I accept
ed an advantageous offer from Captain William Prichard, 
master of the Antelope, who was making a voyage to the 
South Sea. We set sail from Bristol, May 4, 1699, and our 
voyage was at first very prosperous.
 It would not be proper, for some reasons, to trouble the 
reader with the particulars of our adventures in those seas; 
let it suffice to inform him, that in our passage from thence 
to the East Indies, we were driven by a violent storm to the 
north-west of Van Diemen’s Land. By an observation, we 
found ourselves in the latitude of 30 degrees 2 minutes 
south. Twelve of our crew were dead by immoderate labour 
and ill food; the rest were in a very weak condition. On the 
5th of November, which was the beginning of summer in 
those parts, the weather being very hazy, the seamen spied 
a rock within half a cable’s length of the ship; but the wind 
was so strong, that we were driven directly upon it, and im
mediately split. Six of the crew, of whom I was one, having 
let down the boat into the sea, made a shift to get clear of the 
ship and the rock. We rowed, by my computation, about 
three leagues, till we were able to work no longer, being al
ready spent with labour while we were in the ship. We 
therefore trusted ourselves to the mercy of the waves, and in 
about half an hour the boat was overset by a sudden flurry 
from the north. What became of my companions in the 
boat, as well as of those who escaped on the rock, or were 
left in the vessel, I cannot tell; but conclude they were all 
lost. For my own part, I swam as fortune directed me, and

was pushed forward by wind and tide. I often let my legs 
drop, and could feel no bottom; but when I was almost gone, 
and able to struggle no longer, I found myself within my 
depth; and by this time the storm was much abated. The de
clivity was so small, that I walked near a mile before I got to 
the shore, which I conjectured was about eight o’clock in 
the evening. I then advanced forward near half a mile, but 
could not discover any sign of houses or inhabitants; at least 
I was in so weak a condition, that I did not observe them. I 
was extremely tired, and with that, and the heat of the 
weather, and about half a pint of brandy that I drank as I left 
the ship, I found myself much inclined to sleep. I lay down 
on the grass, which was very short and soft, where I slept 
sounder than ever I remembered to have done in my life, 
and, as I reckoned, about nine hours; for when I awaked, it 
was just day-light. I attempted to rise, but was not able to 
stir: for, as I happened to lie on my back, I found my arms 
and legs were strongly fastened on each side to the ground; 
and my hair, which was long and thick, tied down in the 
same manner. I likewise felt several slender ligatures across 
my body, from my arm-pits to my thighs. I could only look 
upwards; the sun began to grow hot, and the light offended 
my eyes. I heard a confused noise about me; but in the pos
ture I lay, could see nothing except the sky. In a little time I 
felt something alive moving on my left leg, which advanc
ing gently forward over my breast, came almost up to my 
chin; when, bending my eyes downwards as much as I could, 
I perceived it to be a human creature not six inches high, 
with a bow and arrow in his hands, and a quiver at his back.
